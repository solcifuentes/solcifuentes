### Hi there 👋

I'm Sol, a software developer based in ⛰ Barcelona 🌊 .  

I'm a graduate of the Full Stack Development bootcamp at CodeOp, and I've been working as a Teacher Assistant for 5 months now.

I have a creative background and over 10 years of experience supporting companies and organisations to improve their communication by creating better experiences and content for their users.

I hold a Master's Degree in French as a Foreign Language and work as a French-Spanish translator. 

My passion for teaching led me to roles as a Literature Professor at the university and as a French teacher. I find great joy in learning new languages and exploring new worlds through these languages. 

I am fluent in English 🇺🇸 , French 🇫🇷, Spanish 🇦🇷/ 🇪🇸, and Catalan 🎗.
